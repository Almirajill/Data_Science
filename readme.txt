Therefore, businesses of all sizes require data science to study and transform data into practical information. 

   In addition, the types of data that data scientists analyze can be both structured and unstructured. Structured data in tabular format, organized in rows and columns and stored in a database, and unstructured data, including numbers, text, images, videos, or audio files, can be analyzed by data scientists. By analyzing these large volumes of structured and unstructured data, data scientists can produce meaningful insights and make informed decisions.

II. The role of a data scientist

   The application of data science in businesses is crucial, as it enables them to extract valuable insights and take necessary actions to remain competitive in the market. Data scientists are essential for companies to make better and more informed decisions. Data science enables businesses to identify new patterns and trends, establish relationships between variables, and visualize data. This can help companies maximize their profits, prevent significant losses, and predict and prevent future problems, including detecting and preventing fraud.

    Furthermore, data science can help companies gather customer feedback, develop new ideas for products and services, and create solutions to meet customers' needs. This, in turn, can result in greater customer satisfaction and increased profit. A data science strategy is also essential for businesses, as it allows them to attract new customers through targeted ads. Companies can use customers' browsing histories to gain insights into their interests and show them products and services that fit their preferences.

III. The data science process 

A. Problem formulation

   The initial phase of a data science project involves problem formulation, where the data scientist collaborates with stakeholders to identify the problem, determine the relevant data sources, and establish project goals. The key to this phase is to ask the right questions that will enable the team to gain a comprehensive understanding of the problem and define the appropriate questions that require answers. Questions such as "What happened?", "Why did it happen?", "What kind of data do we need to collect?", "What is the objective of the project?", "What are the current challenges?", "What can be done presently?", and "What will happen in the future?" may be useful during this phase. The purpose of this stage is to ensure that the problem is well defined and the right data is gathered to help address the issue effectively. This step is critical in the data science process, as it sets the stage for the rest of the project.

B. Data collection

   In the data science process, after the problem has been identified, relevant data must be collected from various sources. Data scientists play a significant role in this step, which involves identifying and collecting the appropriate data. To collect data, they first check the pre-existing data that is available to them. If that's insufficient, they move on to collecting new data from different sources. They collect data from various sources, such as internal company data, public data sets, relational databases, market research, surveys, web scraping, server logs, and website cookies. Data scientists must have access to large amounts of data to conduct their analysis, and they collect data from multiple sources using various methods. It's worth noting that the data collected at this stage is raw and could be corrupted, have missing values, or have errors.

C. Data preparation

   This is a crucial step in the data science process, involving the cleaning and transformation of raw data to make it usable. Raw data is typically disorganized and may contain missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, making it necessary to clean and standardize the data before analysis. Data cleaning involves identifying missing data values and filling them in if necessary, correcting inaccuracies and errors, removing duplicate values, identifying corrupt records, and dealing with inconsistent data. This step is time-consuming, but it ensures the accuracy of the data for the rest of the data science process.

D. Exploratory data analysis and modeling

   After preparing the data, the next step in the data science process involves performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain a better understanding of the data. Data exploration allows the analysis of the data in-depth, narrowing down the data that is essential for answering the initial questions, uncovering patterns, and extracting meaningful insights. Data scientists utilize statistical methods and data visualization tools to create diagrams, charts, and graphs that represent evident trends and correlations in the data. Based on the insights gained from the EDA, data scientists select an appropriate machine learning or statistical model to analyze the data. They use algorithms, machine learning, and artificial intelligence techniques to build, evaluate, deploy, and monitor a machine learning predictive model for the data. The model may be used for prediction, classification, or clustering, depending on the problem. Furthermore, data scientists perform hypothesis testing, predict and forecast highly accurate outcomes, and determine the best actionable steps for the future. This step is crucial in providing impactful recommendations based on the data analysis.

E. Interpreting and communicating results

   The final stage of the data science process involves communicating and presenting the results to stakeholders, clients, and decision-makers in an understandable and persuasive manner. It is crucial to present the findings in a way that non-technical individuals can comprehend. Effective communication skills are crucial for a data scientist to possess, as they play an essential role in conveying the significance and relevance of the insights and recommendations generated from the data. This phase is commonly referred to as "data storytelling," where the data scientist uses the results and insights obtained from the previous stages to weave a compelling narrative that highlights the relevance of the findings and their implications for the business. During this phase, the data scientist provides answers to the questions they identified in the first step of the process.





   2. Differentiate data and information.(GARCIA)

I. Data in data science

   In data science, data is a collection of raw and unorganized facts that require processing to make them meaningful. These individual units of information, represented by variables in analytical processes, can be considered as statistics and facts collected for reference or analysis. Data is meaningless until interpreted by either a human or a machine to derive meaning. It usually contains numbers, characters, and statements in a raw form.

II. Information in data science

   Information is defined as structured, processed, and organized data that is presented in context to make it relevant and useful to the intended recipient. Information is data that has been transformed and categorized into an understandable form that can be used in the decision-making process. Essentially, when data becomes useful after conversion, it is considered information. It provides answers to specific questions and can be obtained from a variety of sources, including newspapers, the internet, television, people, and books.

III. Difference in data and information

   Data:
    1. Data are the variables that help to develop ideas/conclusions.
    2. Data are text and numerical values.
    3. Data doesn’t rely on information.
    4. Bits and bytes are the measuring units of data.
    5. Data can be easily structured as the following: 
         1. Tabular data 
         2. Graph 
         3. Data tree
    6. Data does not have any specific purpose.
    7. It is low-level knowledge.
    8. Data does not directly helps in decision making.
    9. Data is a collection of facts, which itself have no meaning.
    10. Example of data is student test score.

   Information:
    1. Information is meaningful data.
    2. Information is a refined form of actual data.
    3. While information relies on data.
    4. Information is measured in meaningful units like time, quantity, etc.
    5. Information can also be structured as the following: 
         1. Language 
         2. Ideas 
         3. Thoughts
    6. Information carries a meaning that has been assigned by interpreting data.
    7. It is the second level of knowledge.
    8. Information directly helps in decision making.
    9. Information puts those facts into context.
    10. Example of information is average score of class that is derived from given data.





   3. Describe data processing life cycle.(CAROLINO)
The data processing life cycle is a systematic approach to managing and transforming data from its raw state to valuable insights. It consists of several stages that work together to ensure that data is collected, prepared, analyzed, visualized, reported, and maintained accurately and effectively.
1) Data Collection is the first step involved in the data processing cycle. It is validated by prioritizing the information resources provided, such as the company's profits and losses, user data, staff data, market net worth, and other necessary data, after acquiring the raw information from other organizations in the enterprise.

2) Data Preparation in the processing cycle involves the duties to prioritize the data collected and filter out the unnecessary and inaccurate data. Before the conclusion, the errors in the data, replication of the data, duplicate data, and such misleading data are corrected and filtered to guarantee the quality. Once the data quality is checked, it is then encoded for further cycle. Because of all the methods used, the term "data cleaning" is also used to describe this step of data processing.

3) The Data Input stage of data processing is where the cleaned or encoded data is transformed into inputs that can be read by machines. It is ensured that the data is in a format that can be read by a computer and processed before feeding it to the computer. At this stage of the case, the priority is to validate the data before supplying it to the computer's Central Processing Unit (CPU).

4) Data Processing makes the data subject to various data processing methods like algorithmic and statistical calculations, depending on the tools that are being used. Most of the available tools make use of algorithms designed using machine learning and artificial intelligence for processing the cleaned data.

5) Data outputs are the form of data that has been processed and obtained by the previous steps. The output data obtained is then decoded which is ready to be displayed to the users. These outputs help the users immediately extract the statistics. Based on these extracted statistics, the presentation is done. For presentation, charts, reports, tables, graphs, and other such information-conveying statistics are used.

6) Storage is a major asset in any kind of data processing. The final step in the cycle is to store the decoded output data and metadata for future calibration and use. Through this, the user would be able to retrieve any particular data whenever needed. For a reliable use, the organizations buy huge amounts of memory to store all the data.
     In conclusion, the data processing life cycle is a continuous process that involves the collection, preparation, input, output, reporting, and storage. It is an iterative process, and the stages may be repeated multiple times to refine the results and improve the quality of the data. This process helps organizations to make informed decisions, gain a competitive advantage, and achieve their goals.
