Introduction (GARCIA)

	In today's data-driven world, information is power. With the vast amounts of data available, data science has emerged as a critical field that helps organizations make informed decisions and gain a competitive edge. Data science is an interdisciplinary field that combines various techniques from computer science, statistics, mathematics, and domain expertise to extract valuable insights from data. These insights can be used to drive business decisions, optimize operations, and develop new products and services. In this way, data science has become a key enabler of digital transformation, with organizations across industries investing in data science to stay competitive in today's fast-paced and rapidly evolving market.
	
	Through this research, the aim is to understand the critical role that data science plays in modern society and contribute to the advancement of the field by identifying opportunities for further development. Also, this research aims to provide a comprehensive overview of data science by examining the role of data scientists, differentiating between data and information, describing the data processing life cycle, understanding various data types from diverse perspectives, discussing the data value chain in the emerging era of big data, and exploring the basics of big data and the purpose of Hadoop ecosystem components. 

	Over the past few decades, the world has experienced a data revolution, with the amount of data generated by individuals, organizations, and machines growing exponentially. Data science involves various techniques and fields that have gained significant attention in recent years due to the exponential growth of data and the advancements in computing technology. The field has emerged as a critical tool in various industries, including finance, healthcare, manufacturing, and technology. With the rise of Industry 4.0, data science has become even more relevant as it plays a critical role in unlocking the value of data generated by smart and connected systems. As a result, there is a growing demand for skilled data scientists who can help organizations harness the power of data to gain a competitive edge. However, as the field of data science continues to evolve, researchers are faced with various challenges such as data privacy concerns, interpretability issues, and bias, which need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of data-driven decision-making. Despite these challenges, data science has emerged as an essential tool for organizations across industries, shaping the future of how the world is understood and interacted with. Hence, there is a growing need for research that explores the current state of data science, the challenges it faces, and proposes potential solutions to overcome them and advance the field further. The insights and knowledge gained through data science have the potential to transform industries and society as a whole, making it crucial to continue exploring and advancing this field through ongoing research and innovation.
