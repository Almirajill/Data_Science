   1. Describe what data science is and the role of data scientists.(GARCIA)

I. The data science

   The generation of vast amounts of digital data in our daily lives has made data science an increasingly critical field. Data science involves collecting and analyzing digital data, extracting insights, making informed decisions, and converting the data into meaningful and valuable actions. Additionally, data science is a multidisciplinary field that employs various tools, methods, and technologies that evolve over time. It combines probability, statistics, mathematics, data analysis, artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer science, algorithms, programming, and business to extract insights and knowledge from data. Therefore, businesses of all sizes require data science to study and transform data into practical information. 

   In addition, the types of data that data scientists analyze can be both structured and unstructured. Structured data in tabular format, organized in rows and columns and stored in a database, and unstructured data, including numbers, text, images, videos, or audio files, can be analyzed by data scientists. By analyzing these large volumes of structured and unstructured data, data scientists can produce meaningful insights and make informed decisions.

II. The role of a data scientist

   The application of data science in businesses is crucial, as it enables them to extract valuable insights and take necessary actions to remain competitive in the market. Data scientists are essential for companies to make better and more informed decisions. Data science enables businesses to identify new patterns and trends, establish relationships between variables, and visualize data. This can help companies maximize their profits, prevent significant losses, and predict and prevent future problems, including detecting and preventing fraud.

    Furthermore, data science can help companies gather customer feedback, develop new ideas for products and services, and create solutions to meet customers' needs. This, in turn, can result in greater customer satisfaction and increased profit. A data science strategy is also essential for businesses, as it allows them to attract new customers through targeted ads. Companies can use customers' browsing histories to gain insights into their interests and show them products and services that fit their preferences.

III. The data science process 

A. Problem formulation

   The initial phase of a data science project involves problem formulation, where the data scientist collaborates with stakeholders to identify the problem, determine the relevant data sources, and establish project goals. The key to this phase is to ask the right questions that will enable the team to gain a comprehensive understanding of the problem and define the appropriate questions that require answers. Questions such as "What happened?", "Why did it happen?", "What kind of data do we need to collect?", "What is the objective of the project?", "What are the current challenges?", "What can be done presently?", and "What will happen in the future?" may be useful during this phase. The purpose of this stage is to ensure that the problem is well defined and the right data is gathered to help address the issue effectively. This step is critical in the data science process, as it sets the stage for the rest of the project.

B. Data collection

   In the data science process, after the problem has been identified, relevant data must be collected from various sources. Data scientists play a significant role in this step, which involves identifying and collecting the appropriate data. To collect data, they first check the pre-existing data that is available to them. If that's insufficient, they move on to collecting new data from different sources. They collect data from various sources, such as internal company data, public data sets, relational databases, market research, surveys, web scraping, server logs, and website cookies. Data scientists must have access to large amounts of data to conduct their analysis, and they collect data from multiple sources using various methods. It's worth noting that the data collected at this stage is raw and could be corrupted, have missing values, or have errors.

C. Data preparation

   This is a crucial step in the data science process, involving the cleaning and transformation of raw data to make it usable. Raw data is typically disorganized and may contain missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, making it necessary to clean and standardize the data before analysis. Data cleaning involves identifying missing data values and filling them in if necessary, correcting inaccuracies and errors, removing duplicate values, identifying corrupt records, and dealing with inconsistent data. This step is time-consuming, but it ensures the accuracy of the data for the rest of the data science process.

D. Exploratory data analysis and modeling

   After preparing the data, the next step in the data science process involves performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain a better understanding of the data. Data exploration allows the analysis of the data in-depth, narrowing down the data that is essential for answering the initial questions, uncovering patterns, and extracting meaningful insights. Data scientists utilize statistical methods and data visualization tools to create diagrams, charts, and graphs that represent evident trends and correlations in the data. Based on the insights gained from the EDA, data scientists select an appropriate machine learning or statistical model to analyze the data. They use algorithms, machine learning, and artificial intelligence techniques to build, evaluate, deploy, and monitor a machine learning predictive model for the data. The model may be used for prediction, classification, or clustering, depending on the problem. Furthermore, data scientists perform hypothesis testing, predict and forecast highly accurate outcomes, and determine the best actionable steps for the future. This step is crucial in providing impactful recommendations based on the data analysis.

E. Interpreting and communicating results

   The final stage of the data science process involves communicating and presenting the results to stakeholders, clients, and decision-makers in an understandable and persuasive manner. It is crucial to present the findings in a way that non-technical individuals can comprehend. Effective communication skills are crucial for a data scientist to possess, as they play an essential role in conveying the significance and relevance of the insights and recommendations generated from the data. This phase is commonly referred to as "data storytelling," where the data scientist uses the results and insights obtained from the previous stages to weave a compelling narrative that highlights the relevance of the findings and their implications for the business. During this phase, the data scientist provides answers to the questions they identified in the first step of the process.





   2. Differentiate data and information.(GARCIA)

I. Data in data science

   In data science, data is a collection of raw and unorganized facts that require processing to make them meaningful. These individual units of information, represented by variables in analytical processes, can be considered as statistics and facts collected for reference or analysis. Data is meaningless until interpreted by either a human or a machine to derive meaning. It usually contains numbers, characters, and statements in a raw form.

II. Information in data science

   Information is defined as structured, processed, and organized data that is presented in context to make it relevant and useful to the intended recipient. Information is data that has been transformed and categorized into an understandable form that can be used in the decision-making process. Essentially, when data becomes useful after conversion, it is considered information. It provides answers to specific questions and can be obtained from a variety of sources, including newspapers, the internet, television, people, and books.
