	Let us first grasp the value chain concept to understand the data value chain. A value chain represents a business's sequential steps to create and deliver a product or service to its customers. It encompasses everything from ideation and production to delivery and post-consumption considerations. It is a vital framework for business planning and organization to succeed. In the 1980s, Porter proposed the value chain concept.
	Beyond its application in business, the value chain can also be utilized as an analytical tool to evaluate information flow and comprehend the value generated by data technology. By examining the different stages involved in data collection, processing, and utilization, we gain insights into how data technology generates value and enhances various aspects of our lives. This understanding emphasizes the importance of each step within the data value chain and its contribution to the overall impact of data technology.
	It has been common practice to overlook the value of data sharing and usage in favor of overly emphasizing data collection and generation. Data sharing has only sometimes been widespread among some people or groups. It is crucial to realize that knowledge is a precious resource that may be utilized and recycled for little to no additional expense. Our goal should be to optimize data usage and reuse to maximize its value. Simply gathering and distributing data does not guarantee its utilization or positive impact. It is crucial to pay greater attention to how data is collected, shared, and utilized, and the data value chain serves as a tool to understand and visualize this process.
	Let us delve into the Data Value Chain (DVC), a systematic framework that outlines a series of procedures to extract maximum value from data at each stage of its lifespan. Like other value chains, the DVC ensures effective data utilization by repeating these steps consistently throughout its entire journey. While traditional value chains focus on managing systems, inputs, and outputs to optimize the end product's quality, cost, and profit, the data value chain differentiates itself by primarily aiming to generate actionable insights rather than tangible products or services. 
	The data value chain serves multiple purposes. As a teaching tool, data can be used to demonstrate the complex processes involved in data generation, usage, and influence. Additionally, it can function as a management tool to monitor and evaluate the data production process, ensuring its effectiveness and efficiency.
	The data value chain comprises four categories: collection, publication, uptake, and impact. In addition to these categories, the data value chain consists of twelve phases. These phases include identifying the data need, collecting and processing it, analyzing it, and subsequently releasing, disseminating, connecting, incentivizing, influencing, and utilizing it for change and impact. Constant feedback between data producers and stakeholders is crucial throughout the process.

Collection: This stage highlights the most basic yet critical statistical activities that focus on determining what data type is needed to solve a problem, answer a question, or monitor a process.

	Identify - recognize the need for data and specify the data requirements to address a particular problem or objective.

	Collect - this process involves data collection and gathering from various sources, such as surveys or retrieval of administrative data or the use of remote sensing methods.

	Processing - includes ensuring that data is appropriately recorded, categorized, and stored in formats. It performs tasks such as cleaning, organizing, converting, and organizing data to make it available for analysis.


Publication: Following data collection, it is necessary to publish both the metadata and the data itself in a manner that allows users of the data to access them. It includes making sure that the data stored is in an open and accessible format, as well as providing adequate documentation to ensure users can understand and interpret the data.

	Analyze - examine the obtained data using various statistical, computational, and analytical approaches to gain insights, detect trends, or make predictions.

	Release - the findings and results of the analysis are compiled and documented into reports, publications, or presentations that can be accessed online or offline that contain machine-readable data.

	Disseminate - the act of providing stakeholders, such as decision-makers or the general public, with the studied data and its insights. This procedure entails publishing recorded reports, publications, or presenting the data.

Uptake: There are several ways in which users can be connected: through press releases and online dissemination; by holding training, seminars, or other educational events; and by improving the user experience on websites, data portals, and archives. Incentives may take a variety of forms.

	Connect - once the data has been collected and published, it is essential to utilize current technology to encourage users to provide more data. This data will enable the reprocessing of the collected data, leading to the discovery of new insights and trends. This data loop is critical for keeping data-gathering procedures accurate and up to date. Additionally, it enables the creation of fresh approaches that will enhance the data-collecting procedure and yield more insightful outcomes.

	Incentivize - In this process, we can make the data access and analysis tools more straightforward and user-friendly, reducing the time and cost associated with using the data. This process will help analyze new data by automating repetitive tasks and keeping this new data up-to-date. To reinforce the value of data utilization, showcasing successful examples of how data-driven decisions have positively influenced outcomes is crucial. Demonstrating the practical benefits, users will understand the value that data can bring to their decision-making processes.

	Influence - this is a process through which users learn and value the worth of data. This procedure involves establishing a culture that encourages the use of data in decision-making processes. In order to accomplish this, fostering an environment in which individuals are provided with the opportunity to use data and emphasizing the benefits and advantages of data-driven decisions, such as greater accuracy, informed insights, and better decision-making. 

Impact: It is common to view the use of development data as the end goal. However, usage occurs during various stages between the publication of the data and encouraging a decision-maker to modify decisions as a result of the data. In order to encourage support for data production, the general public should see apparent positive changes as a result of using the data. Additionally, data must be available, with free licensing for both use and reuse, while providing supplementary resources and capacity-building opportunities. Once this process is in place, the channels connecting the data and its users will strengthen, ensuring a more entrenched and influential data impact.
	
	Use - This stage involves utilizing the data to gain a deeper understanding of a problem or to make informed decisions. It serves as the initial end-use of the data, which is implemented to address specific challenges or support decision-making processes. This iterative process of using data, receiving feedback, which can provide valuable insights, and making adjustments help continuously improve the impact and effectiveness of data utilization.

	Change - this process is vital in bringing about meaningful changes and improvements. It will use the data to utilize in order to bring positive outcomes in projects or to enhance existing situations. Monitoring the behavioral changes can gain insights into the effectiveness of their data-driven approach. That will allow them to identify the patterns and trends that highlight the impact of data utilization on decision-making and actions. Helping formulate data-driven policies that identify the relationship between data utilization and positive outcomes that leverage data effectively.

	Reuse - entails utilizing current data and maximizing its value by merging it with additional relevant data sources. This process enables the development of comprehensive and meaningful analyses that extend beyond the constraints of particular datasets. Data must also be freely shared and made available to various people to have the most significant impact. This promotes teamwork, sharing of data, and idea exchange. Furthermore, encouraging the development of data-use skills and competencies is critical for successfully motivating individuals and organizations to use data for decision-making and problem-solving. By boosting interest in data generation and showcasing the value and advantages that data can provide, a culture of data-driven practices may be nurtured, leading to improve informed decision-making and beneficial outcomes.
